## IMPROVEMENT PROPOSAL

### About users
To improve the system I would add more custom proxy views to be able to optimally 
handle users with a more personalized role assignment and also add actions that are 
triggered according to their behavior when using the application, as well as custom 
views that allow to communicate with the frontend.


### About Unit Test
About unit tests, create unit tests for each API by Request type and an automatic 
Json load expected to validate the values ​​of the expected fields.


### About users interactions with application
What I now add as a type of "wished list" and acts as a counter that is stored in 
the product's history, I would change it to adhere more to the requirement and detect 
the common user through the application cache and create a custom list by products 
viewed and not only those added to the wish lists in order to create another api 
through this history that lets you know which products to recommend per user.

### About Reports and analysis
For the analysis of data and reports, a tool like new relic could be added to see in 
real time the interactions of the users and automatic filling of reports based on 
interactions
